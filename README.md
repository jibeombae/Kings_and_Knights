# Kings_and_Knights

Kings and Knights is a cool Processing animation that simulates a battle game on a checkerboard.
In the game, there are kings, knights, and soldiers.
- Soldiers: They can only move forward. Soldiers are able to kill the opponent's knights.
- Knights: There is one knight for each team. They can move diagonally and they attempt to get to the other team's king. They are able to kill the other team's king.
However, if they encounter a soldier, they die.
- Kings: Kings only move forward and is able to go through any soldiers. If the kings get to their other team's sides without dying to the knight, the team with more
soldiers alive will win.

The starting board can be arranged so that the soldiers are placed in a checkerboard pattern, or randomly. The Kings and Knights are placed randomly behind the soldiers.
All the characters move simultaneously
